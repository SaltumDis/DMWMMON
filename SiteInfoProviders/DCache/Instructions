For chimera based dCache installations chimeraDump one can  use chimeraDump tool provided with dCache.

The tool can be found in this repository (DMWMMON/SiteInfoProviders/DCache/tools/chimeraDump) or in dCache wiki
(http://trac.dcache.org/wiki/contributed/chimeraDump - Recommended Version:  0.9.1).

However, we have slightly modified the tool in our repository to add a dump that generates the information
CMS needs only, so that it runs faster. 

With regular chimeraDump one would run:

  chimera-dump.py  -s <base_cms_path> -c fulldump -o dcache.cms.dump > dump.log

With modified chimeraDump one needs to run:

  chimera-dump.py -s /pnfs/ciemat.es/data/cms -c cmsdump -o dcache.cms.dump > dump.log
  
The result to parse and upload is, in both cases, dcache.cms.dump.
